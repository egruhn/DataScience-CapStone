## Welcome

Within this repository are the necessary files for the Johns Hopkins University Data Science Specialization Capstone Project involving predicting the next word in a text snippet.

- **textPredictor** directory contains the *ui.r* and *server.r* files for the text prediction application, which was created in RStudio using the Shiny package. The application can be viewed at [https://egruhn.shinyapps.io/myCapstone/](https://egruhn.shinyapps.io/myCapstone/).
- *finalTraining.R* contains all the R code used to complete the downloading and splitting of the original data as well as the creation of the various N-grams used in the application.
- *myFunctions.R* contains the R code used for various custom functions that are called throughout the finalTraining program.
- *Capstone_Mileston.RMD* was used for the first assignment and represents the data exploration that was originally completed with small portions of the full data sets.  The compiled HTML version of the code can be viewed at [RPubs](http://rpubs.com/egruhn/Capstone_Milestone_Report).
- *myCapstonePresentation.md* represents the reproducible presentation of the application. HTML version can be viewed [here](http://rpubs.com/egruhn/######).
